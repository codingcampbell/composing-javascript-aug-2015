Talk for Norfolk.js August 2015

Static slides available on [GitHub](https://codingcampbell.github.io/composing-javascript-aug-2015/index.html)

You can also run the dev server to control the presentation (and view slide notes) from a remote device:

1. `npm install`
2. `node tasks dev`
3. Browse to http://localhost:8888/
4. Browse remote device to http://ip-address:8888/r/pair-id

The `pair-id` can be found in the console from step 3.
